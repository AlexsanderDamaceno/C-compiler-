# C compiler 

**A Python-based C subset compiler tailored for the x86 architecture. This project focuses on providing subset of the C programming language into executable for x86 architecture.**


**Key Features:**

* x86 Code Generation:

  * **Translation of C subset code into optimized x86 assembly language.
  Efficient utilization of x86 architecture features for performance.**

* Subset Language Support:

  * **Compiler designed for a specific subset of the C programming language.
  Focus on key constructs for educational and lightweight project use.**

* Abstract Syntax Tree (AST):

  * **Implementation of an AST for intermediate representation.
  Facilitates efficient analysis, optimization, and translation to x86 assembly.**
